This project is to develop a CPU using System Verilog. What have been accomplished are:

Built a pipelined processor with 5 stages: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write Back
Designed a 4-way associative cache with pseudo-LRU replacement policy to improve time efficiency
Developed local branch history table to boost the prediction accuracy by 81%
Added a branch target buffer to improve cpu cycle by 1 and increase frequency up to 104MHZ
